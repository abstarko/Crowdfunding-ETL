# Crowdfunding-ETL

The company has just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. And, Independent Funding wants you to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

In this Challenge, I use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. I extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. I then do the load phase. I also use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, I upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally I performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
